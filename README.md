# LeetGPU Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various problems from [LeetGPU](https://leetgpu.com/challenges). The solutions are written primarily in **Triton**, or specify [CuTeDSL](./CuTeDSL)/CUDA/MOJO🔥 and are categorized by problem. My nickname is [BobHuang](https://leetgpu.com/profile?display_name=BobHuang).

LeetGPU now includes a **solutions feature** within the challenge section. And [AlphaGPU/leetgpu-challenges](https://github.com/AlphaGPU/leetgpu-challenges) has all challenges.

If you're a beginner just getting started with algorithm problems and you're comfortable reading Chinese, feel free to check out my introductory tutorial on Zhihu:
